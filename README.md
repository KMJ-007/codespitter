> VS code extension that spits out your whole code base for you

## Idea:
 Anshuman bhaiya, Krishna and me, we were talking about our sass and explaining how we coded all things to our non tech customer, from a dote to every feature, for explaining how much we coded to non tech guy, he give example that, if we print our whole codebase, it would be around 5000-6000 pages, we didn't think much about it, and now i am building this extension for just fun!
